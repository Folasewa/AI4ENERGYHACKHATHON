# AI4ENERGYHACKHATHON
This folder contains codes, dataset, problem and solution documentation of the AI solution for the just concluded AI for Energy Hackathon organized by Chevron and Data Science Nigeria. 
The solution proposed is a knowledge based web-app CO2 prediction system that predicts the amount of CO2 that would be emitted at the point of Clinker production during Cement Production.
The dataset was synthesized as I couldn't get a processed dataset, I synthesized it by looking through research articles on mixing ratio of cement materials and the basic materials for cement production.
